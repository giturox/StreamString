# StreamString
* Simple storage of data and data structures in streams using UTF8 strings with checksum and fault/noise tolerance.

* The software is in a pre-pre alpha stage right now, but it is usable. 
The interface is undergoing a major rewrite using a result pattern instead of exceptions (exceptions will possibly be optionally enabled in the result pattern though).

* This unit is written for FreePascal V3.2 or later. I may update it to also support Delphi, but for now i use the Freepascal generics.
